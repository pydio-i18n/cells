## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in the code, please do not post an issue directly in Github or in the Forums, but send an email to **security (at) pydio.com**. You may initiate the exchange by asking for out PGP public key to encrypt further messages.

_Scope of disclosure_: if you would like to limit further dissemination of the information in the report, please say so in it. Otherwise the Pydio team may share information with other vendors if we find they may be affected by the same vulnerability. The Pydio Team will handle the information you provide responsibly.

_Getting feedback_: we cannot guarantee a prompt human response to every security bug filed. Still, it will probably a matter of hours before you get an answer. If you donâ€™t, please try contacting us by other means to check that the message was correctly received and acknowledged.
