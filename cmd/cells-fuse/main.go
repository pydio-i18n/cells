DESCRIPTION

  This tool allows the local mounting of a flat datasource, given a "snapshot" has been created in the storage. 
  It does NOT require a running Cells/Cells Enterprise instance nor MySQL connection.
  It currently supports local filesystem and S3-based datasources.

  Using cells-fuse can be useful in case of emergency to recover files from a flat datasource.

EXAMPLES 

  1. Mount Local datasource
  $ ` + os.Args[0] + ` mount --t /tmp/datasource --s file:///var/cells/data/pydiods1/snapshot.db

  2. Mount Remote S3 datasource (note the s3s scheme)
  $ ` + os.Args[0] + ` mount --t /tmp/datasource --s s3s://API_KEY:API_SECRET@s3.amazonaws.com/MyBucketName/snapshot.db

  3. Lookup for a file (without mounting the datasource)
  $ ` + os.Args[0] + ` lookup --storage file:///var/cells/data/pydiods1/snapshot.db --name "*" --type file --base "/folder/path"

  4. Copy a specific file (without mounting the datasource) to a local location
  $ ` + os.Args[0] + ` copy --storage file:///var/cells/data/pydiods1/snapshot.db --from "/folder/path/file.ext" --to "./file.ext"

  5. Display tool version
  $ ` + os.Args[0] + ` version
