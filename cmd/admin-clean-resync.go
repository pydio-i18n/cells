DESCRIPTION

  TriggerResync is a generic gRPC endpoint that can be implemented by various services to perform internal
  clean-up or resynchronization.

  This can be currently used for datasources (see 'admin datasource' commands), search engine, logs (for truncating).
  The "path" can be used by some services to read additional parameters.

EXAMPLES

  To trigger the re-indexation of "pydiods1" datasource, target the "sync" service associated to the datasource : 

  1. Equivalent to "admin datasource resync" command:
  $ ` + os.Args[0] + ` clean admin resync --service=pydio.grpc.data.sync.pydiods1 

  2. Re-index search engine:
  $ ` + os.Args[0] + ` clean admin resync -s pydio.grpc.search

  3. Truncate logs to a given size (in bytes):
  $ ` + os.Args[0] + ` clean admin resync --service=pydio.grpc.logs --path=TRUNCATE/200000
